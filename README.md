## Overview
Welcome to our WhatsApp Direct Messaging App, Whosthat! This project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to message any phone number on WhatsApp without the hassle of saving the number on their device. It leverages the WhatsApp API to enable this functionality, making communication more efficient and user-friendly with saving those spam mobile numbers.

## How it Works
This app utilizes the WhatsApp API to facilitate direct messaging to any phone number. Users simply enter the desired phone number and compose their message within the app. The app then interfaces with the WhatsApp API to deliver the message without requiring the number to be saved in the user's contacts.

## Features
- Direct messaging to any phone number on WhatsApp.
- No need to save contacts on the device.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Usage
1. Enter the phone number of the recipient.
2. Compose your message.
3. Alias (For usecases require you to revisit contacts later, without actually saving them in phonebook)
4. Click on the send button.
5. Voila! Your message is sent directly to the recipient's WhatsApp.
